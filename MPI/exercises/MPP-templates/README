A few useful files for the MPI course.

The file "cirrusmpi.job" should be used for submitting MPI jobs to the
compute nodes of Cirrus using the SLURM batch system. Instructions are
included as comments in the file itself.

For very small test jobs on Cirrus, you can run interactively on the
login node using: mpirun -n 4 ./hello

The file "archer2mpi.job" should be used for submitting MPI jobs to
the compute nodes of ARCHER2 using the SLURM batch system. Instructions
are included as comments in the file itself.

The Makefiles might be easier to use than compiling by hand. They are
set up to deal with multiple source files, although they currently
only contain a single file.

You will have to edit the Makefile for your target system. Apropriate
compiler settings are included for the EPCC systems ARCHER2 and
Cirrus, although one of these will be commented out so you may have to
edit these lines.
